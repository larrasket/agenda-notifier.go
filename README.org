-----
agenda-notifier.̶e̶l̶ go is a basic notification daemon for org-mode agenda, a part of the free software text
editor GNU/Emacs.
-----
* Features
+ Actually works.
+ Emacs independent, so you will get notified even if Emacs is not running (it
  runs its own process of Emacs).
+ Reminder notification before an event.
* Requirements
+ The ~notify-send~ command. (preinstalled in most GNU/Linux distributions)
+ It uses ~kdialog~ in the case of [[https://kde.org/][KDE]].
* Installation
First [[https://go.dev/doc/install][install Go]]. Then run:
#+begin_src shell
go install github.com/larraskt/notifier.go/notifier@latest
#+end_src

Now ~notifier~ should be located at ~$GOPATH/bin/~ (Probably ~$HOME/go/bin~).
* Usage
Auto start the ~notifier~ command with your system, there are many ways to do so, [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/autostarting][this]] page
could be useful.
** Configuration
The configuration file should be found at ~$HOME/.config/agn/config.yaml~, and
it is generated automatically.

#+begin_src yaml
# Whether you are using Emacs or Doom Emacs[fn:3].
doom: true
# Emacs ~init.el~ or ~.emacs~ location.
emacsInitFile: /home/ghd/.doom.d/
# Scan interval (in seconds) for checking for changes in org-agenda
scanInt: 300
# Time (in minutes) before getting a reminder of an event.
beforeNotification: 30
# ~doomscript~ binary location, in case of doom.
doomScriptLoc: /home/ghd/.emacs.d/bin/doomscript
#+end_src

* Why?
Because:
1. It is hard to maintain (sometimes, impossible[fn:1][fn:2]) asynchronous code inside Emacs environment.
2. Debugging Elisp can be painful, compared to other languages. I tired to use
   [[https://github.com/spegoraro/org-alert][spegoraro/org-alert]], [[https://github.com/doppelc/org-notifications][doppelc/org-notifications]], [[https://github.com/akhramov/org-wild-notifier.el][akhramov/org-wild-notifier.el]] and others
   but I couldn't get persistence with any, and I couldn't also debug to tell what was the
   problem. Actually I told myself then it would be easier to rewrite it rather
   than debugging it, and here we go.

[fn:2] Elisp capability of using threads is often described as 'limited'.
